# OrderedArrayList

* Have to import ArrayList as the parent class.
* Discussed about how both NoNullArrayList and OrderedArrayList could be in the same file, but likely shouldn't.
  * Every part should be in its own file.
* The super method should be called frequently and check whether any elements in the array is null.
* Could possibly be a problem with the remove method for sorting, might insert the element at the wrong index.
* add and set methods are being inherited.
